# TwitchPy
an asynchronous python wrapper API for twitch's IRC chat.

# About
i made this mainly for fun and because other wrappers/api of this kind don't support features that i really wanted. it's very poorly and 
sloppily written and lacks a lot of features. and who knows when i'm going to stop support for this. so if you're looking for something more robust and professionally made, try out [TwitchIO](https://github.com/TwitchIO/TwitchIO).

# Installation
if you are keen on installing this, i'm not going to stop you. i'm not confident enough to make this a PyPi package, so the best way to install this would probably be 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/rexosorous/TwitchPy
```

# Requirements
Python 3.8+
