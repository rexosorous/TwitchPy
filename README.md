# TwitchPy
an asynchronous python wrapper API for twitch's irc chat.

# About
i made this mainly for fun and because other wrappers/api of this kind don't support features that i really wanted. it's very poorly and 
sloppily written and lacks a lot of features. if you're looking for something more robust and professionally made, try out 
[TwitchIO](https://github.com/TwitchIO/TwitchIO).
