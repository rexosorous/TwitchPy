# TwitchPy
An asynchronous python wrapper API for twitch's IRC chat.

# Documentation
https://twitch-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# About
I made this mainly for fun and because other wrappers/api of this kind don't support features that I really wanted. It's developed and maintained entirely by me so it's not going to be very rich in features or very robust, but it gets the job done for what I want.

# Installation
I did not make this a PyPi package so the best way to install this would probably be

```
pip install git+https://github.com/rexosorous/TwitchPy
```

# Requirements
Python 3.8+
