# TwitchPy
An asynchronous python wrapper API for twitch's IRC chat.

# Documentation
https://twitch-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# About
I made this mainly for fun and because other wrappers/api of this kind don't support features that I really wanted. It's very poorly and
sloppily written and lacks a lot of features. And who knows when I'm going to stop support for this. So if you're looking for something more robust and professionally made, try out [TwitchIO](https://github.com/TwitchIO/TwitchIO).

# Installation
If you are keen on installing this, I'm not going to stop you. I'm not confident enough to make this a PyPi package, so the best way to install this would probably be

```
pip install git+https://github.com/rexosorous/TwitchPy
```

# Requirements
Python 3.7+
